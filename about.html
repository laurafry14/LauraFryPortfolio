      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="para">
        My name is Laura Fry and I was born and raised in St. John's,
        Newfoundland. From an early age I discovered my passion in mathematics,
        science and technology. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Engineering
        from Memorial University in 2020. Graduating during a global pandemic
        had it's difficulties but it made me realize what industry I wanted to
        be a part of. The technology industry is full of bright and passionate
        people who want to make a difference in the world. I then decided to
        enrole in Keyin College's Software Development Program.

        My engineering degree has allowed me to gain experience in sevreal
        different industries such as Oil and Gas, Mineral Processing and the
        Aerospace Industry. I gained valuable problem solving skills and met
        some amazing mentors in the process. I slowly began to realize that my
        passion was not engineering however I hope to carry these experiences
        over as I transition into the tech industry.

        When I quit my job to pursue my dream of becoming a software developer I
        was nervous but very excited for the future. I am now about to start my
        third semester at Keyin and I couldn't be more excited. I will be
        graduating in December of 2023 and I will be seeking a junior software
        developer role at this time in either front-end or back-end development.

        On my free time I love playing sports. I play volleyball, softball,
        golf, squash and whatever else I can make time for. I also love to
        downhill ski in the winter. Another passion of mine is cooking and
        baking as I find it very rewarding. Staying active and having hobbies is
        very important to maintain a healthy work-life balance
